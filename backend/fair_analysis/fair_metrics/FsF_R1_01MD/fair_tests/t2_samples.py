The model uses historical temperature data to predict global temperature anomalies. ## Data Files The following data files are included in the repository: | File Name | Type | Size (MB) | Description | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `temperature_data.csv` | CSV | 100 | Historical daily temperature records (1940-2022) | | `station_metadata.csv` | CSV | 50 | Metadata for temperature stations, including location and elevation | | `grid.nc` | NetCDF | 500 | Global grid data for climate model output | ## Measured Variables The following variables are included in the dataset: * **Temperature (Â°C)**: daily mean temperature at each station * **Elevation (m)**: elevation of each temperature station above sea level * **Latitude**: geographic latitude of each temperature station * **Longitude**: geographic longitude of each temperature station ## Data Format All data files are in CSV or NetCDF format and can be easily read using Python libraries such as pandas and netcdf4. ## Notes Please note that the `temperature_data.csv` file is a large file (100 MB) and may take some time to download or process.""",
