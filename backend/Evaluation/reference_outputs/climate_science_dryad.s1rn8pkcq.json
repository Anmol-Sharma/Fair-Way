        "summary": "Managing climate change impacts on already imperiled species requires understanding how climate affects their survival. We studied this for the West Coast breeding population of snowy plovers (Charadrius nivosus), listed as threatened in 1993 due to significant declines in breeding numbers and sites. Snowy plovers have a serially polygamous system where males typically raise the chicks—a behavior influenced by male-biased sex ratios. Using mark-capture data from 1,219 banded plovers over 38 years in Monterey Bay, we examined climate effects on adult survival. While sex and non-climate factors like predation were primary drivers, prolonged cold weather—with lows below 2°C and highs under 10°C—reduced winter survival, especially for females, reinforcing male-biased ratios. With future winters projected to be warmer and less severe, reduced cold-related mortality may offset some threats like predators and habitat loss, while potentially influencing sex ratios and the species' breeding dynamics.",
