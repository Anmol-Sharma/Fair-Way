        "summary": "This study addresses the limited data on hospital costs for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) survivors in the UK, crucial for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of interventions within the NHS. We retrospectively reviewed ICU admissions at a London hospital over 18 months from January 2011, focusing on in-hospital costs by survival and neurological outcome, with secondary analysis estimating cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using existing survival and utility data. Of 69 patients admitted post-return of spontaneous circulation, 48% survived to discharge, with 26 in favorable neurological states (CPC 1-2). The average cost per hospital survivor was £50,000, rising to £65,000 for CPC 1-2 survivors. ICU care accounted for 69% of total costs, with CPC 1-2 patients incurring lower costs and shorter stays than those with poorer outcomes. The estimated cost per QALY for CPC 1-2 survivors was £16,000, suggesting these interventions are economically justifiable.",
