        "summary": "The Levant region is highly vulnerable to climate change, experiencing prolonged heat waves that have led to societal crises and population displacement. Since 2010, the area has been marked by socio-political turmoil, including the Syrian civil war, which has strained neighbouring countries like Jordan due to the influx of Syrian refugees. Jordan, in particular, has seen rapid population growth and significant changes in land use and infrastructure, leading to over-exploitation of the landscape through irrigation and construction. This article uses climate data, satellite imagery, and land cover information to illustrate the substantial increase in construction activity and highlights the intricate relationship between climate change predictions and current socio-political developments in the Levant.",
