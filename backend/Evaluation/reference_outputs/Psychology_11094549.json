Data from Colombia and Chile was collected between August, 2021, and April, 2022. Data for Spain was collected between September and November 2011. Demographic variables and responses to items on the Health Care Providers\u2019 Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale (HC-PAIRS) are included. Although the language of the file is originally Spanish, the variable names and value labels have been translated into English for easier understanding. Data and codebooks are provided in csv format, following the FAIR principles. Three files are provided: 1. HC-Pairs data, with the data related to sample characteristics and the answers to the questionnaire items in the three countries. 2. Database codebook of variables, with information of the labels of the variables of the HC-Pairs data file. 3. Variables values codebook, with the labels of the values of the variables in the HC-Pairs data file.",
